Keep all the data sets as in the sequence as it is in repo.
Because for maximum datasets uploaded locally, the path is "../datasets/dataset_name.json"
".." means a folder back, and then enter to "datasets" folder, and then select the "dataset.json". 

So keep your dataset and file in this order, or you can manually set your path.
